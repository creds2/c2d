```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
x = c(1, 2)
```
# c2d

The goal of c2d is to host code for loading data used in creds2.

Fun example in Python to show reproducible code:

```{r, engine='python'}
import numpy as np
x = [1, 2, 4, 9]
y = [2, 3, 5, 6]
# import matplotlib
z = np.add(x, y)
print(z)
```

## Flow diagram

The plot below, generated using reproducible code stored in the script `data-flow-diag.R`, is a data flow diagram ([DFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_diagram)).
We will modify this as the project evolve as we clarify the work to be done.

```{r, message=FALSE}
source("data-flow-diag.R")
render_graph(g, layout = "tree")
```
